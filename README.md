# Devil's Pie 2

Devil's Pie 2 is based on the excellent program Devil's Pie by Ross Burton.
It will read Lua scripts from a folder and run them whenever a window is
opened, and the rules in them are applied on the window. (See the
[Configuration section](#configuration) for more details.)

Unfortunately the rules of the original Devil's Pie are not supported.

`devilspie2` will load all the Lua files in this folder in alphabetical order.

`devilspie2` accepts the following options:

|   |   |
|:--|:--|
| `-h`, `--help`         | Show help options |
| `-d`, `--debug`        | Print debug information to stdout |
| `-D`, `--debug-fifo`   | Print debug info & copy stdout to a FIFO |
| `-P`, `--print-fifo`   | Print the debug FIFO's file name then quit |
| `-e`, `--emulate`      | Don't apply any rules, only emulate execution |
| `-f`, `--folder`       | Search for scripts in this folder |
| `-v`, `--version`      | Print program version then quit |
| `-w`, `--wnck-version` | Show libwnck version then quit |
| `-l`, `--lua-version`  | Show Lua version then quit |

If you run `devilspie2 --debug-fifo`, you can connect to its FIFO at any
time and see the same text as for `devilspie --debug`. The reason for this
is to allow `devilspie2` to be dæmonised while still having access to
debugging output etc. at need.

A useful way of doing this is to run, in a terminal, this command:
```sh
cat "$(devilspie2 -P)"
```
(No text backlog will be shown; if there's nothing reading the FIFO, nothing
is written to it.)

## Configuration

Scripts are read from the scripts folder, which is customisable by using the
`--folder` option. By default, this folder is `~/.config/devilspie2/`.
(`~/.config` is the default location as defined in the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/)
and returned by the GLib function `g_get_user_config_dir`. As such, it can
also be overridden by the environment.)

This folder will be created if it doesn't already exist.

If `devilspie2` doesn't find any Lua files (`*.lua`) in the folder, it will
stop execution. (Dot-files – those with names beginning with `.` – are
ignored.)

As of v0.46, each script has 5 seconds to do its job and exit or it will be
unceremoniously interrupted.

### Going beyond the default behaviour

If there is a file named `devilspie2.lua` in the script folder, it is read and
executed first. You can choose to have all script functionality in this
file or you can split it up into several.

Whilst the default behaviour is to run all scripts on window open events, Devil's Pie 2 also supports other window-related events (close, focus, blur, name/title change).

#### Per-event actions

If you want actions to be taken on particular events, you'll need to define which scripts are to be run on each event type. This is done via the following variables:

* `scripts_window_open` (See [Below](#scripts_window_open))
* `scripts_window_close`
* `scripts_window_focus`
* `scripts_window_blur`
* `scripts_window_name_change`

These variables can be:
* A single string, naming a file to run for that event, for example:
  ```lua
  scripts_window_focus = "file1.lua"
  ```
* A Lua table, listing multiple files, for example:
  ```lua
  scripts_window_close = {             
    "file1.lua",
    "file2.lua"
  }
  ```
The files named:
* are expected to be in the scripts folder;
* will only be called when the respective events occur;
* can be run on multiple events (as with `file1.lua` in the above examples).

*All other* Lua script files in the scripts folder will be called whenever a
window is opened (unless [`scripts_window_open`](#scripts_window_open) is specified).

#### `scripts_window_open`

Specifying the `scripts_window_open` variable in `devilspie2.lua` is significant for a couple of reasons:
* It affords control over which scripts in the folder are executed, which could be useful if you want to exclude scripts for any reason, or just to be sure of what is being run.
* It allows the `require`ing of modules _within_ the script folder.  Lua has mechanisms to avoid executing `require`d modules more than once that the default behaviour of Devil's Pie 2 circumvents and renders inoperable.

If you don't want to handle window open events (unlikely) but do want to be able to `require` a module within the script folder you can set `scripts_window_open` to an empty value:
```lua
scripts_window_open = {}
or
scripts_window_open = ""
```

## Scripting

The scripting language used is [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
* FAQ:           https://www.lua.org/faq.html
* Documentation: https://www.lua.org/docs.html
* Tutorials:     http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory

Tips:

* If you're going to be testing certain window properties a lot, it's best to
  assign those property values to variables then to test the variables.
* String comparison is case sensitive.  Comparing `SomeProgram` with
  `someprogram` will not report equality.


The following commands are recognised by the Devil's Pie 2 Lua interpreter:

### Debugging

First, a function to show some debug info:

* `debug_print(string)`
  <a name="user-content-debug-print" />

  Debug helper which prints a string to `stdout` if `devilspie2` is run with
  the `--debug` option; otherwise does nothing.

### Getters

Then there are the functions to get the properties of a window, and related
information:

* `get_window_name()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-name" />

  Returns a string containing the name of the current window.

* `get_window_has_name()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-has-name" />

  Returns a boolean value indicating whether the window has a name.

  *(Available from version 0.20)*

* `get_application_name()`
  <a name="user-content-get-application-name" />

  Returns the application name of the current window.

* `get_process_name()`
  <a name="user-content-get-process-name" />

  Returns the name of the process owning the current window.

  On (at least) Linux, the process name is read from `/proc/<pid>/comm`. If
  that's not possible, `ps` is launched in a shell. For this reason, you
  should avoid calling `get_process_name()` more than necessary.

  *This function is not compatible with busybox `ps`.*

  *(Available from version 0.44)*

* `get_window_geometry()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-geometry" />

  Returns the window geometry as four numbers - x-position, y-position,
  width and height. For example, you can do something like this:

  ```lua
  x, y, width, height = get_window_geometry();
  print("X: "..x..", Y: "..y..", width: "..width..", height: "..height);
  ```

  *(Available from version 0.16)*

* `get_window_client_geometry()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-client-geometry" />

  Returns the window geometry excluding the window manager borders as four
  numbers, x-position, y-position, width and height.

  See [`get_window_geometry`](#user-content-get-window-geometry) for an
  example on how to use this function.

  *(Available from version 0.16)*

* `get_window_frame_extents()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-frame-extents" />

  Returns the window frame extents as four numbers: left, right, top, bottom.

  *(Available from version 0.45.)*

* `get_window_is_minimised`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-is-minimised"></a>

  Returns `true` if the window is minimised, `false` otherwise.

* `get_window_is_decorated()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-is-decorated" />

  Returns `true` if the window is decorated, `false` otherwise.

  *(Available from version 0.44.)*

* `get_window_type()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-type" />

  Returns the type of the window. The result type is a string, and can
  be one of the following:
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_MENU`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASHSCREEN`
  * `WINDOW_TYPE_UNRECOGNIZED` (if libwnck didn't recognise the type)
  * `WINDOW_ERROR` (if there's no window to work on)

  *(Available from version 0.21)*

* `get_class_instance_name()`
  <a name="user-content-get-class-instance-name" />

  Get the class instance name from the WM_CLASS property for the current

  *(Available from version 0.45)*

* `get_window_property_full(string property)`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-property-full" />

  Returns a list suitable for assignment to two variables, equivalent to calling

  i.e. For 3 workspaces "First space", "Second" & "Third and final" and IDs of 1, 2 & 3 the returned tables
  would be:
  ```lua
  local by_name, by_id = get_workspaces()
  by_name = {
    "First space" = 1,
    "Second" = 2,
    "Third and final" = 3

  (Obtained via the current window's Screen)

  *(Available from version 0.46)*

* `get_window_workspace()`
  <a name="user-content-get-window-workspace"/>

  Returns 2 values: the index and name of the workspace the current window is on.

  *(Available from version 0.46)*

  Returns `true` if the window is fullscreen, `false` otherwise.

  *(Available from version 0.32)*

* `get_monitor_index()`
  <a name="user-content-get-monitor-index" />

  Returns the index of the monitor containing the window centre (or some
  part of the window).

  *(Available from version 0.44)*

* `get_monitor_geometry([int index])`
  <a name="user-content-get-monitor-geometry" />

  Returns x, y, width, height for the given monitor or,
  without parameters, for the window's monitor.

  If the index is out of range, nothing is returned.

  *(Available from version 0.44 without parameter)*

### Setters

And the rest of the commands are used to modify the properties of the windows:

* `set_adjust_for_decoration([bool])`
  <a name="user-content-set-adjust-for-decoration" />

  Allow for situations where moving or resizing the window is done
  incorrectly, i.e.
  ```lua
  set_window_position(0,0)
  ```
  results in the window decoration being taken into account twice, i.e.
  the window (including decoration) is offset from the top left corner by
  the width of the left side decoration and the height of the title bar.

  This is currently off by default, and is sticky: if you do not explicitly
  set it in your script, its current value is retained.

  If used, it should be used at the start of the script.

  This affects the following functions:
  * [`set_window_geometry`](#user-content-set-window-geometry)
  * [`set_window_position`](#user-content-set-window-position)
  * [`set_window_size`](#user-content-set-window-size)
  * [`xy`](#user-content-xy)
  * [`xywh`](#user-content-xywh)

  *(Available from version 0.45)*

* `set_window_position(int xpos, int ypos, [int index])`
  <a name="user-content-set-window-position" />

  Set the position of a window.

  If `index` is specified then the co-ordinates are relative to a corner of
  the specified monitor (counting from 1) on the current workspace. Which
  corner is determined by the co-ordinates' signs:
  * +ve `X` ⇒ left, -ve `X` ⇒ right;
  * +ve `Y` ⇒ top,  -ve `Y` ⇒ bottom.

  **NOTE:** since `-0` would have a use here but is equal to `+0`, `~`
  (bitwise NOT) is used. To put the window 60 pixels from the right or bottom,
  use `~60` or `-61`.

  If `index` = `0` then the ‘current’ monitor (with the window's centre
  point) is used (falling back on then the first monitor showing part of the
  window then the first monitor).

  If `index` = `-1` then all monitors are treated as one large virtual
  monitor.

  *(`index` parameter available from 0.46)*

* `set_window_position2(int xpos, int ypos, [int index])`
  <a name="user-content-set-window-position2" />

  Set the position of a window. Parameters are as for
  [`set_window_position`](#user-content-set_window_position).

  This function uses `XMoveWindow` instead of `wnck_window_set_geometry`; this
  gives a slightly different result.

  *(Available from version 0.21, `index` from 0.46)*

* `set_window_property(string property, int-or-string value, [bool utf8])`
  <a name="user-content-set-window-property" />

  Set a property of a window to a string or a cardinal (32-bit integer or
  boolean).

  Optionally takes a boolean to indicate `UTF8_STRING` properties. The
  default is initially `false` and can be set via
  [`use_utf8()`](#user-content-use-utf8). Ignored for non-string values.

  *(Available from version 0.44; UTF-8 option available from version 0.45.)*

* `delete_window_property(string property)`
  <a name="user-content-delete-window-property" />

  Remove a property from a window.

  *(Available from version 0.44)*

* `set_window_size(int width, int height)`
  <a name="user-content-set-window-size" />

  Set the size of a window.

* `set_window_geometry(int xpos, int ypos, int width, int height, [int index])`
  <a name="user-content-set-window-geometry" />

  Set both size and position of a window in one command.

  The `index` parameter works exactly as for
  [`set_window_position()`](#user-content-set-window-position) and affects
  the given coordinates in the same way.

  *(`index` parameter available from 0.46)*

* `set_window_geometry2(int xpos, int ypos, int width, int height, [int index])`
  <a name="user-content-set-window-geometry2 " />

  Set the window geometry as for
  [`set_window_geometry()`](#user-content-set-window-geometry), but using
  `XMoveResizeWindow` instead of its libwnck alternative.  This may result
  in different coordinates, more like the original devilspie geometry
  function.

  *(Available from version 0.21; `index` from 0.46)*

* `shade()`
  <a name="user-content-shade" />

  Centre the window on one monitor or across all monitors, according to the
  following rules:

  * If `index` = `-1`, all monitors are treated as one large virtual monitor.
  * If `index` = `0`, the ‘current’ monitor (with the window's centre point)
    is used (falling back on then the first monitor showing part of the

* `millisleep(int time)`
  <a name="user-content-millisleep" />

  Sleep for a number of milliseconds, between 1 and 1000 (1 second).

  This is a convenience function so that you don't have to use `os.execute`
  (to run `sleep`) or (from LuaPosix `posix.time`) `nanosleep`.

  *(Available from version 0.46)*

### Simple script examples

**Showing debug output and resizing and maximisation of specific windows:**

```lua
-- the debug_print command only prints to stdout
-- if devilspie2 is run using the '--debug' option
debug_print("Window name: " .. get_window_name());
debug_print("Application name: " .. get_application_name())

-- I want my Xfce4 terminal to the right on the second screen (1080p) of my
-- two-monitor setup.
-- Note that this rule will only work with the window's initial title.
if (get_window_name() == "Terminal") then
   set_window_position(1300, 200, 2)
   set_window_size(600, 800)
end

-- Make Firefox always start maximised.
if (get_application_name() == "Firefox") then
   maximise() -- maximize() for compatibility with <0.45
end
```

**Showing handling of conflict between `devilspie2` and other programs (in this case,
`emacs`):**

This example uses [millisleep](#user-content-millisleep) to enforce a short
delay.

```lua
-- Make Emacs (emacs or emacs-gtk) always start maximised.
win_class = get_class_instance_name()

debug_print("Window class: " .. win_class)

if win_class == "emacs" or win_class == "Emacs" then
  -- Emacs applies default window size etc. after a brief delay,
  -- potentially overriding devilspie2.
  --
  -- A brief pause (here, of 0.1s) ensures that devilspie2's actions on the
  -- window take effect after Emacs completes its initialisation. A shorter
  -- pause may work, or a longer one may be needed. Experiment! Could be
  -- that 'millisleep(10)' (0.01s) works well on one PC…?
  --
  -- If you prefer, you can have Emacs maximise its window (as in this
  -- example) via one of its configuration files - early-init.el, which is
  -- normally faster (and avoids a possible visual effect), or init.el –
  -- using this LISP statement:
  --   (push '(fullscreen .  maximized) default-frame-alist)
  --
  -- 'millisleep' is new to 0.46. The 0.1s delay for older versions:
  --   option 1:
  --     os.execute("sleep 0.1")
  --   option 2 (needs luaposix):
  --     nanosleep = require "posix.time".nanosleep
  --     nanosleep{tv_nsec=100e6}
  millisleep(100)
  maximise() -- maximize() for compatibility with <0.45
end
```
